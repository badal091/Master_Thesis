# Cross-Attention and ViT for Multi-Task Learning

Our main objective is to leverage vision transformer (ViT) and cross-attention take it from classification tasks to semantic segmentation and then later to multi-task learning, by designing new models that incorporate both concepts.

Multi task learning include classification, semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation & surface normal estimation etc.
